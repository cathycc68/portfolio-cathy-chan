# About Me
I am a dedicated and versatile professional with five years of experience in special education, along with a passion for user experience design. I have a proven record of reliability, problem-solving skills, and obtaining results to meet and exceed the requirements set forth by stakeholders. I am currently completing a 12-week remote junior web developer training program through Generation USA. During this time, I gained substantial knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as refining important soft skills such as effective communication and teamwork.
My career goal is to become a UX Designer whilst utlizing my new knowledge of front-end applications to best support the engineering teams.
